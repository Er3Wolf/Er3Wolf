**Hi**, I'm Emanuele Lapenna (emaxlap).\
First of all I welcome you to my neocities site, I hope that what you'll find here will inspire you or simply won't make you feel like you wasted time on a random website.\
I always liked the idea of having a personal space on the internet, but not in the form of a social media page, more like in the form of a crazy mess shaped by you.\
In the next pages we'll talk about why I designed the site like this and other stuff.\
You can check this website's content also on [Github](https://github.com/emaxlap-rs/emaxlap-rs). I tried my best to dynamically integrate the repository content into the site.\
*cya*
